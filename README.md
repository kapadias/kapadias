### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

As a Data Science leader with over 7 years of industry experience and a Master's degree in Operations Research from Northeastern University, I have developed a strong skill set in advanced analytical techniques, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making. My past projects include work on search engines, recommender systems, and AI ethics.

On my GitHub profile, you can find a range of projects that showcase my technical skills and expertise in the field of data science. In addition to my technical skills, I am also committed to the ethical development of artificial intelligence and ensuring that its benefits are distributed fairly.

I am always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and stay up to date with the latest developments in the field. I enjoy sharing my experience through writing data science tutorials and articles, and I hope that my GitHub profile can serve as a helpful resource for others in the data science community.

Thank you for visiting my profile.
