### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

As a Data Science leader with **over a decade of industry experience** and a Masterâ€™s degree in Operations Research from Northeastern University, Iâ€™ve developed a strong skill set in advanced analytical techniques, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making. My past projects span large-scale AI solutions at global organizationsâ€”like Walmart, Randstad, and Monster Worldwideâ€”encompassing search engines, recommender systems, and pioneering work in AI ethics.

On my GitHub profile, youâ€™ll find a range of projects showcasing my technical expertise in data science and machine learning. In addition to my coding endeavors, I am deeply committed to the ethical development of artificial intelligence, striving to ensure its benefits are distributed fairly and transparently.

I am always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and stay current with the latest developments in the field. I enjoy sharing my experiences through tutorials, articles, published research, and mentorshipâ€”and I hope my GitHub can serve as a helpful resource for others in the machine learning community.

Thank you for visiting my profile.

### Speaking Engagements
I regularly speak at global conferences on topics like large-scale AI solutions, algorithmic fairness, and real-world applications of NLP and recommender systems. Iâ€™ve also served as a mentor and judge at hackathonsâ€”guiding teams to award-winning results. If youâ€™re looking for a speaker or mentor, feel free to reach out!
